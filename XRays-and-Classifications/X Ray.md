An X-ray is a type of electromagnetic radiation that has a higher energy level than visible light. It was discovered by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen in 1895, and he named it "X" as it was an unknown form of radiation at that time. X-rays have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than visible light, making them able to penetrate through soft tissues and some materials.

In medical imaging, X-ray machines are commonly used to create images of the internal structures of the human body. X-ray imaging is a non-invasive way to diagnose and monitor various medical conditions by producing images of bones, organs, and tissues. X-ray images are often used to detect fractures, infections, tumors, and other abnormalities.

During an X-ray procedure, the patient is exposed to a controlled dose of X-ray radiation, and the X-rays pass through the body to create a shadow-like image on a film or digital detector. Dense structures like bones appear white or light gray on the X-ray image, while less dense tissues appear darker.

X-rays are also used in various other fields, such as security screening at airports, industrial testing, and scientific research. However, it's essential to use X-rays with caution, as excessive exposure to radiation can be harmful. Medical professionals carefully control the dose of radiation used in X-ray procedures to minimize risks to patients.
