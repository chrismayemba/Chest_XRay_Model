## Purposes of Conducting a Chest Radiograph
- **Preoperative evaluation:** Chest radiographs are often performed before [[Orthopedics|orthopedic]] surgery to assess the patient's overall health and to rule out any underlying chest conditions that could complicate the surgery. For example, a chest radiograph can be used to check for pneumonia, heart disease, or lung cancer.
- **Evaluation of chest injuries:** Chest radiographs can be used to evaluate patients with chest injuries, such as rib fractures, pneumothorax, or hemothorax. This information can help the doctor to determine the severity of the injury and to plan the best course of treatment.
- **Monitoring of patients with orthopedic conditions:** Chest radiographs can be used to monitor patients with orthopedic conditions, such as scoliosis or osteoporosis. This can help the doctor to track the progress of the condition and to make sure that the patient is responding to treatment.
- **Diagnosis of venous air embolism:** Venous air embolism is a rare but serious condition that occurs when air bubbles enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart and lungs. Chest radiographs can be used to diagnose venous air embolism, and they can also be used to monitor the condition during treatment.

In addition to these specific uses, chest radiographs can also be used to provide general information about the patient's chest, such as the size and shape of the heart, the presence of any masses, and the condition of the lungs. This information can be helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of orthopedic conditions.
