X-rays are a versatile and widely used tool in medical imaging, providing valuable insights into the internal structures of the human body. They work by emitting a controlled dose of ionizing radiation, which passes through the body and is absorbed at different rates by various tissues, producing images that highlight bone, soft tissue, and air-filled structures. This non-invasive imaging technique has revolutionized medicine, allowing healthcare professionals to diagnose and monitor a wide range of medical conditions with relative ease and speed.

## Different Usage of X Rays in Medical Imaging

### [[Chest Radiography|Chest Radiography (Chest X-rays)]]:

Chest X-rays are performed to assess the condition of the heart, lungs, and chest wall.
They are particularly useful in diagnosing and monitoring respiratory issues such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer.
They are also useful for finding the number and location of of different cases of Rib Fractures along with the severity of their injuries.
Chest X-rays provide valuable information about the size and shape of the heart and can detect conditions like congestive heart failure.


### [[Computed Tomography (CT)]]:

CT scans, also known as CAT scans, utilize X-rays from multiple angles to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body.
The images produced are far more detailed than traditional X-rays and offer three-dimensional views of organs and tissues.
CT scans are invaluable for diagnosing complex medical conditions, such as tumors, vascular abnormalities, and injuries to internal organs.
They are commonly used in emergency settings to assess trauma patients quickly and accurately.


### [[Orthopedics]]:

X-rays are essential in orthopedics for evaluating bone injuries, joint problems, and degenerative conditions like arthritis.
They help orthopedic surgeons determine the extent of fractures, identify joint abnormalities, and plan surgical interventions.
X-rays are commonly used for follow-up evaluations to monitor the healing progress of fractures and surgical outcomes.


### [[Mammography]]:

Mammography is a specialized X-ray technique used for breast cancer screening and early detection.
It involves compressing the breast tissue to obtain clear images that can detect tiny abnormalities, including early-stage tumors. Mammography does use a slightly higher dose of radiation than chest radiography
Mammograms play a crucial role in improving breast cancer survival rates by enabling early diagnosis and timely intervention.


### [[Dentistry]]:

X-rays are commonly used by dentists to examine teeth and the underlying bone structure. Dental X-rays is a form of  [[Medical Imaging|medical imaging]] technique which aids in detecting cavities, impacted teeth, and other dental problems.


### [[Angiography]]:
X-ray angiography helps visualize blood vessels and detect blockages or abnormalities, assisting in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions.
